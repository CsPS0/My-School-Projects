# UNO Rules 🎴  

## 🎯 Objective  
The goal is simple: **be the first to reach 500 points!**  
You earn points by being the first to play all your cards in a round. Any cards left in your opponents’ hands will give you extra points.  

## 🃏 Setup  
- UNO can be played with **2 to 10 players**.  
- Each player starts with **7 cards**.  
- The rest of the deck is placed **face-down** as the draw pile.  
- The top card is flipped over to **start the discard pile**.  
  - If the first card is an action card (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, or Wild Draw Four), the effect **still applies**!  

## 🔹 Card Types  
UNO has **two types of cards**:  

### 🎨 Number Cards (0-9)  
These are **regular** cards in four colors: **red, green, blue, and yellow**.  

### 🎭 Action Cards  
These cards **shake up the game** with special effects:  
- **Skip ⏭️** – The next player loses their turn.  
- **Reverse 🔄** – Changes the direction of play.  
- **Draw Two ➕2** – The next player must draw **two cards** and lose their turn.  
- **Wild 🎨** – The player chooses the next color to be played.  
- **Wild Draw Four 🎨➕4** – Choose a new color AND force the next player to draw **four cards**! (But only if you don’t have a matching color to play.)  

## 🚀 How to Play  
1️⃣ The player **to the left** of the dealer goes first.  
2️⃣ Each turn, you must **match** the card on the discard pile by **color, number, or symbol**.  
3️⃣ If you **can’t play**, draw a card!  
   - If the drawn card **matches**, you can play it immediately.  
   - If not, your turn **ends**.  
4️⃣ Use action cards **strategically** to make your opponents struggle! 😈  

## 🔥 Special Actions  
- **Skip** – The next player **misses** their turn.  
- **Reverse** – Changes the game’s direction (clockwise ↔️ counterclockwise).  
- **Draw Two** – The next player **draws 2 cards** and skips their turn.  
- **Wild** – Choose **any color** to continue the game.  
- **Wild Draw Four** – Pick a new color **and** make the next player **draw 4 cards** (only if you have no playable colors).  

## 🗣️ Calling "UNO!"  
When you’re down to **one card**, you **must** shout **"UNO!"** 🎉  
If someone catches you **before your next turn**, you have to **draw 2 cards** as a penalty! 😱  

## 🏆 Winning a Round  
A round **ends** when a player plays their **last card**.  
Then, all remaining cards in opponents’ hands give the winner **extra points**:  
- **Number cards (0-9):** Face value  
- **Skip, Reverse, Draw Two:** 20 points  
- **Wild, Wild Draw Four:** 50 points  

## 🏅 Winning the Game  
The first player to reach **500 points** is the **ultimate UNO champion!** 🏆  

Have fun and play smart! 😉
